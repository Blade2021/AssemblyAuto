### Timer Vs Timer-2VAR[EEPROM]
Timer was built as a test script for main functionality.  However Timer-2VAR[EEPROM] was made for a backup sketch in case a user needs to write a bigger number then 255 to the EEPROM.  It separates the variable and writes it to EEPROM.  This version will also use twice the amount of EEPROM memory!
